An important part of any computational research is dealing with data, either data used as input or
generated by codes during simulations. This lesson present several strategies to process data more efficiently
not only from the point of view of computers but also for humans trying to make sense that abundant amount 
of data that we deal often.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This tutorial requires familiarity with command line interface, examples with binary formats will use interpreted languages such as Python or R, a basic knowledge of those language allows focusing on the data processing techniques rather than language itself.
