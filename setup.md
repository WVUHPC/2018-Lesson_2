There are a set of code, data and examples for the lessons. 
You can download all of them with:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/WVUHPC/2018-Data-HandsOn.git
~~~
{: .language-bash}


Once you execute the git command, you should have a folder called 2018-Data-HandsOn
and in there a set of folders matching the 4 day-workshop and subfolders for each lecture.
